I am not sure as yet how to implement these buttons, but in theory they would interact with the graph, with the user being able to zoom in on points, refresh the graph back to its original view, scroll along the axes, and save a picture of where they move to. These controls come built in with matplotlib, but the documentation is rather difficult for a beginner to understand so i will have to look into it more.  
Other than that, this is a basic generated matplot graph and interface that i have customised slightly for the needs. The buttons prev and next will change screens to the previous or next uploaded data, along with its summary and possibly chat box.

The user inputs the text they want to send and then either presses enter or clicks the send button. this gets sent to the chat. curerntly it is cheesing it and i manually assigned my name to the messages by hardcoding, as there is no user login feature yet.
